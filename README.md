# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to do a deeper analysis on Pyber rideshare data: specifically, grouped by type of city (urban, suburban, or rural) to compare certain metrics. By doing so, we will be able to provide findings and recommendations to the PyBer team.
## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
##### Total Fare by City Type

To come to these results, we grouped the data by city type, found the total fares for each, then charted them in a time line chart, which captured about a half a year of data. From this chart we can draw some obvious conclusions:
- Urban fares are the highest
- Surburban fares are second
- Rural fares are the lowest

This is consistent with what common sense dictates, that less people per capita means less people needing rides, and less business for a rideshare company. The rural share in the beginning was close to 0! This tells us that we should focus our efforts on the higher earning markets, urban and suburban.

## Summary
Here are three recommentations for the CEO based on my findings:
1. The urban market seems to sustain itself quite well without need for additional effort. We could take another look at the resources allocated to this market, and re-distribute them places that could be improved. For example...
2. The suburban market is successful, but could it be more? We could re-divert some resources in search of getting more rides there. Don't overlook this group just because it's so steadily profitable.
3. There are a lot of unanswered questions about the rural demographic. I would recommend a study into making sure we can't bump up those numbers. They increased from near 0 to $500 total from January to April; what was the cause of that? The answers we find may allow us to adjust our approach, and make more revenue in a historically not so profitable market.
